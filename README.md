Wanderlust — Full-Stack Social Travel Experience Platform

Wanderlust is a community-driven full-stack web platform that reimagines travel sharing as a social experience. It enables users to post listings, share genuine reviews, and explore destinations through interactive maps, encouraging discovery and meaningful connections through user-generated travel insights.

The platform allows travelers to explore places, contribute reviews, and share their own travel experiences. Each listing displays details such as images, price, location, and average reviews, making it a collaborative space for travel inspiration. The system combines social interaction with technical precision, providing secure user management, data consistency, and responsive UI design.

Core features include the ability for users to add, edit, and view travel listings with descriptions, pricing, and images. A review system allows posting, and deletion of reviews, contributing authentic feedback for each location. The Mapbox API and SDK are integrated for visualizing destinations and performing forward geocoding to convert location names into coordinates. Cloudinary Cloud Service is used for smooth image uploading, optimization, and management. Authentication and authorization are implemented using Passport.js, sessions, and cookies for secure login, signup, and access control. Validation and error handling utilize JOI, custom middleware, and error classes for both client-side and server-side validation. The database design demonstrates one-to-many relationships between users, listings, and reviews using MongoDB and Mongoose. The application follows the MVC design pattern for modular code structure and ensures a responsive interface across devices through Bootstrap, Flexbox, and CSS Grid. The platform is hosted on Render, with cloud database support from MongoDB Atlas for scalability and performance.

The tech stack includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, EJS, Bootstrap, Flexbox, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose ORM, Mapbox API, Mapbox SDK, Cloudinary Cloud, Git, GitHub, Postman, Render, and VS Code.

Wanderlust follows the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture, where the Model defines MongoDB schemas and relationships, the View uses EJS templates to dynamically render pages with real-time content, and the Controller manages routes, business logic, authentication, and validation.

Key implementations include RESTful APIs for CRUD operations across listings and reviews, session-based authentication for persistent user state, flash messages for success and error notifications, and asynchronous operations for smooth user interactions. The project is fully deployed on a cloud-based environment ensuring scalability and secure access.

Building Wanderlust strengthened practical understanding of full-stack application design and deployment, third-party API integration, backend scalability with authentication and authorization, and implementation of clean coding practices through the MVC architecture.

This project demonstrates end-to-end development capabilities — from conceptualization to deployment — blending creativity, usability, and technical depth. Wanderlust connects travelers through stories, not just destinations, turning exploration into a shared experience.
